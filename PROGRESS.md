# Project Propper: Progress Report

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** Alpha / Active Development

## Executive Summary
**Propper** is an AI-powered "Pre-Handoff Guardian" that ensures Figma components meet engineering requirements before development begins. It bridges the gap between design and code by auditing components for missing states, accessibility attributes, and token compliance, and provides "Auto-Scaffold" capabilities to repair them.

## Major Milestones Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Planning & Strategy (Completed: Feb 7, 2026)
- **Product Definition:** Finalized PRD, Success Criteria, and User Journeys.
- **Architectural Blueprint:** Designed a multi-layered architecture featuring:
  - **Turborepo Monorepo** for unified development.
  - **Stateless Vercel Proxy** for secure, knowledge-driven audits.
  - **Figma Plugin** for designer-facing workflows.
  - **Developer CLI** for CI/CD and pre-commit verification.
- **Methodology Selection:** Adopted the **"Code Only Props"** hidden-layer pattern (Nathan Curtis) for importing API metadata back into Figma.

### ✅ Epic 1: Design System Rules Foundation (Implementation: In Review)
- **Centralized Schema:** Created `packages/core` with Zod-based validation schemas for primary components (Button, Input, Card).
- **Validation Engine:** Developed logic to detect:
  - Missing boolean states (Disabled, Loading, Error).
  - Missing accessibility metadata (`aria-label`, `accessibilityLabel`).
  - Hardcoded visual values (Token misalignment).
- **Self-Testing:** Established a robust test suite to ensure validation parity across all tools.

## Current Development Progress

### 🏗️ Epic 2: Designer Audit & Repair Workflow (Active)
- **Plugin UI Scaffolded:** React-based plugin interface is functional with "Idle" and "Communication" states established.
- **Proxy API Active:** Vercel Proxy endpoint (`/api/audit`) is live and successfully integrated with the Rules Engine.
- **Ongoing:** Currently implementing component selection extraction logic and the "Auto-Scaffold" layer generation engine.

## Roadmap & Next Steps

### ⏭️ Short Term (Epic 2 Completion)
- Connect the full audit loop: Plugin Selection -> Proxy Audit -> UI Scorecard.
- Implement the "Magic Move": One-click layer generation for missing properties.

### 🚀 Mid Term (Epic 3: Developer Verification)
- Scaffold the `propper` CLI.
- Implement Figma URL auditing via the `figma-console` MCP server.
- Create local `husky` pre-commit hooks to enforce design contracts.

### 🌟 Vision
- Support for complex component sets (ShadCN/WAI-ARIA).
- Automated drift detection between Design and Code.
