# Project Propper: Progress Report

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** Alpha / Active Development

## Executive Summary
**Propper** is an AI-powered "Pre-Handoff Guardian" that ensures Figma components meet engineering requirements before development begins. It bridges the gap between design and code by auditing components for missing states, accessibility attributes, and token compliance, and provides "Auto-Scaffold" capabilities to repair them.

## Major Milestones Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Planning & Strategy (Completed: Feb 7, 2026)
- **Product Definition:** Finalized PRD, Success Criteria, and User Journeys.
- **Architectural Blueprint:** Designed a multi-layered architecture featuring:
  - **Turborepo Monorepo** for unified development.
  - **Stateless Vercel Proxy** for secure, knowledge-driven audits.
  - **Figma Plugin** for designer-facing workflows.
  - **Developer CLI** for CI/CD and pre-commit verification.
- **Methodology Selection:** Adopted the **"Code Only Props"** hidden-layer pattern (Nathan Curtis) for importing API metadata back into Figma.

### ✅ Epic 1: Design System Rules Foundation (Complete)
- **Centralized Schema:** Created `packages/core` with Zod-based validation schemas for primary components (Button, Input, Card).
- **Validation Engine:** Developed logic to detect:
  - Missing boolean states (Disabled, Loading, Error).
  - Missing accessibility metadata (`aria-label`, `accessibilityLabel`).
  - Hardcoded visual values (Token misalignment).
- **Self-Testing:** Established a robust test suite to ensure validation parity across all tools.
- **Stories Completed:** All 5 stories (1-1 through 1-5) done or in review.

## Current Development Progress

### 🏗️ Epic 2: Designer Audit & Repair Workflow (Active)
- **Plugin UI Scaffolded:** React-based plugin interface is functional with "Idle" and "Communication" states established.
- **Proxy API Active:** Vercel Proxy endpoint (`/api/audit`) is live and successfully integrated with the Rules Engine.
- **Component Selection Extraction:** Implemented logic to extract selected component data from Figma.
- **Audit Loop Connected:** Full audit cycle from Plugin Selection → Proxy Audit → UI Scorecard is functional.
- **Auto-Scaffold Implemented:** One-click "Code Only Props" layer generation engine for missing properties.
- **Remaining:** Optimistic UI polish (2-6), telemetry (2-7), and Vercel deployment (2-8).

## Roadmap & Next Steps

### ⏭️ Short Term (Epic 2 Completion)
- Polish UI with optimistic updates and loading states.
- Implement anonymous telemetry for usage insights.
- Deploy proxy to Vercel for production use.

### 🚀 Mid Term (Epic 3: Developer Verification)
- Scaffold the `propper` CLI.
- Implement Figma URL auditing via the `figma-console` MCP server.
- Create local `husky` pre-commit hooks to enforce design contracts.

### 🌟 Vision
- Support for complex component sets (ShadCN/WAI-ARIA).
- Automated drift detection between Design and Code.
